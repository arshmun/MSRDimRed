# Dimensionality Reduction for Molecular Simulations data in R

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generate extensive biomolecular trajectory datasets across time. However, high dimensionality complicates extracting meaningful insights into relationships between protein structure, motion, and function. This project presents an automated unsupervised machine learning workflow, for dimensionality reduction of protein MD simulations data using PCA to uncover conformational dynamics.


Protein biomolecular simulations do not just provide static protein structures â€“ they enable us to study structural changes and movements over time. The dynamic motions or movements and conformational transitions captured in simulation trajectories can provide critical insights. MD simulations produce large high-dimensional datasets and therefore interpreting the insights for these datasets are challenging. Hence, dimensionality reduction techniques are applied by researchers to find the essential protein motions. PCA is a widely utilised dimensionality reduction technique because it transforms the high dimensional MD simulations data into fewer dimensions while still retaining the most important protein motions.

The aim was to develop the workflow following the principles of Open Science, which focuses on spreading knowledge using digital and collaborative technology, so that it can be accessed by anyone who wants to work with biomolecular or MD simulations and PCA. This endeavour is being accomplished by sharing the scripts, R markdown, and supporting files on GitHub under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GNU GPL license will ensure the software remains free, while providing the users with the right to use, study, share, and modify the work. The importance of open-source code and openly available data cannot be overstated for the community of researchers working with MD simulations and PCA. These elements will enable and encourage collaboration, further innovation, and discovery within the community while fostering novel contributions within the MD simulations domain.
